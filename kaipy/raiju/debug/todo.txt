----- Advection testing -----

-- Purely azimuthal advection --
  - Config:
    - Corotation on, no espot. Can do very low energy channel count, but must have plasmasphere
  - Analyis:
    - Exact checking of velocity, revolution period
    - For each revolution, check least-squares error vs t=0 profile

-- Purely meridional advection --
  - Config:
    - No corotation (/Kaiju/Gamera/prob/doCorot="F")
    - electrostatic potential such that only meridional motion is allowed
    - make potential such that velocity should be constant in the equatorial plane
    - separate test where velocity is constant in the ionosphere

-- Non-zero eletrostatic potential --
  - Config:
    - Espot equations from Baumjohann book (eqs in section 5.2.2)
