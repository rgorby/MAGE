This directory contains module lists to use for MAGE build regression tests.

Any file name can be used, as long as the name ends with .lst.

Do not remove or rename 01.lst - it is used internally by the testing code.

The first line is optional. If used, it is of the form:

CMAKE_ENV=...

where everything to the right of the '=' is a set of commands to set environment variables *before* cmake on the cmake command line.

The second line is optional. If used, it is of the form:

CMAKE_OPTIONS=...

where everything to the right of the '=' is a set of command-line arguments for the cmake command. These appear *after* cmake on the cmake command line.

The rest of the file is a list of modules to losf prior to running cmake and make, one module per line.
