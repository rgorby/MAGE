# Project Kaiju #

### Introduction ###

`Kaiju` software includes the [Multiscale Atmosphere-Geospace Environment
(MAGE)](https://cgs.jhuapl.edu/Models/) model developed by the
[Center for Geospace Storms (CGS)](https://cgs.jhuapl.edu/) as well as
other scientific software for simulation of heliospheric environments
such as planetary magnetospheres and the solar wind. 

### Current version ###

Currently
supported applications include 
[MAGE](https://cgs.jhuapl.edu/Models/) (version 1.25)
and [GAMERA-helio](https://cgs.jhuapl.edu/Models/gamera.php), i.e., the
geospace and inner heliosphere applications of the `kaiju`
software. `MAGE 1.25` includes [GAMERA](https://cgs.jhuapl.edu/Models/gamera.php) global magnetosphere
model, the `RAIJU` model of the inner magnetosphere, which is a full
rewrite of the [Rice Convection Model (RCM)](https://cgs.jhuapl.edu/Models/rcm.php), the [REMIX](https://cgs.jhuapl.edu/Models/remix.php) ionospheric electrodynamics
module and the
[TIEGCM](https://www.hao.ucar.edu/modeling/tgcm/tie.php) model of the
ionosphere-thermosphere.

### NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center availability ###

Users are also welcome to run previous versions of `MAGE` via the
NASA's [Community Coordinated Modeling
Center](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/). `MAGE` versions
[0.75](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/MAGE~0.75/) and
[1.0](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/MAGE~1.00/) are available for
runs on request. `MAGE 0.75` includes `GAMERA`, `REMIX` and `RCM`. `MAGE
1.0` adds two-way coupling with `TIEGCM` to `MAGE 0.75`.

`GAMERA-helio` is also available for runs on request at the [CCMC](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/GAMERA-Helio~1/).
