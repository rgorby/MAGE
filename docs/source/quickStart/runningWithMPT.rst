Running MPI jobs with MPT requires some modifications to the PBS submission scripts on any cluster (Cheyenne, Pleiades, likely others). Those modifications are outlined below.

Note: when compiling with MKL in addition to MPT and MPI, MKL should be enabled in the initial cmake command when initializing the build directory to allow the code to compile

.. code-block:: shell

   cmake -DENABLE_MPI=ON -DENABLE_MKL=ON ..

Mpirun Command
--------------

Inside a typical PBS submission script using Intel MPI, when the mpi application is executed the command would like something like this:

.. code-block:: shell

   mpirun ${EXE} ${RUNID}.xml ${JNUM} > ${RUNID}.${JNUM}.out

mpirun is the mpi launcher used with Intel MPI (and several other MPI libraries), and it runs the executable defined by the ${EXE} environment variable. However, MPT has three differences. First, it uses the launcher mpiexec_mpt instead of mpirun. Second, it requires explicit information about how to pin the applications threads to processor cores (something that Intel MPI can do automatically). And finally, MPT requires an additional environment variable allowing us to create complex custom data types.

The same line above must be replaced by these lines in a submission script using MPT:

.. code-block:: shell

   export MPI_TYPE_DEPTH=32
   export MPI_IB_CONGESTED=0
   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=36
   export NODEFILE=$TMPDIR/nodefile.$PBS_JOBID
   cp $PBS_NODEFILE $NODEFILE
   mpiexec_mpt ${KAIJUHOME}/scripts/preproc/correctOMPenvironment.sh ${NODEFILE} omplace ${EXE} ${RUNID}.xml ${JNUM} >> ${RUNID}.${JNUM}.out

Note that this does require the user to have set the TMPDIR environment variable at the top of the script, which is recommended on Cheyenne. If the script does not use TMPDIR, then NODEFILE should be set to simply "nodefile.$PBS_JOBID".

This also requires the user to have set the KAIJUHOME environment variable to the root directory of their kaiju repository (as mentioned in several other wiki pages). This is so that the PBS script can find the "correctOMPenvironment.sh" script. This is a custom replacement for the standard "omplace" script. Because our submission scripts typically have different numbers of MPI processes on different ranks (2 for gamera processes and 1 for voltron processes), the standard omplace script can't properly identify this and pin the processes threads.
