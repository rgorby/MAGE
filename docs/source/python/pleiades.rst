Creating a Python environment for ``kaiju`` on ``pleiades``
===========================================================


Introduction
------------

This file describes how to set up a python ``conda`` environment on
``pleiades`` which can be used to run the ``kaiju`` code.

These steps assume that ``pip`` (only) is used for installing additional
packages, and packages are only taken from PyPI.

These instructions assume you are using the ``bash`` shell.



Building the python environment
-------------------------------

To create a Python environment for ``kaiju``, we first install/load the 
Conda software package, then create the environment, then populate it with 
the required Python packages.

.. note:: These instructions are designed for novice users. If you are
    comfortable with building and managing ``conda``-based environments, feel
    free to build your own environment using the NAS-provided
    `conda <https://www.nas.nasa.gov/hecc/support/kb/managing-and-installing-python-packages-in-conda-environments_627.html>`_
    software.


.. code-block:: bash


    # Load the miniconda3 module.
    module use -a /swbuild/analytix/tools/modulefiles
    module load miniconda3/v4

    # Now create the environment for kaiju, specifying only the python
    # version.
    conda create -n kaiju-3.12 python=3.12

    # Activate the new environment.
    conda activate kaiju-3.12

    # Install the kaipy software.
    # If you are using kaipy via pip:
    pip install kaipy
    # OR
    # If you are using a clone of the kaipy repository:
    pip install -r /path/to/kaipy/requirements.txt


Using the python environment
----------------------------

Once your python environment is created, you must activate it for use with the
``kaiju`` software, and then enable the ``kaipy`` software:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate kaiju-3.12
    source /path/to/kaipy/kaipy/scripts/setupEnvironment.sh
    # or setupEnvironment.csh if using tcsh or a similar shell.
