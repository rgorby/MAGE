Get ready for a Voltron (GAMERA-RCM) run.
=========================================

Voltron is the executable name for the standard magnetosphere simulation. It consists of GAMERA global MHD model and RCM ring current model. GAMERA-RCM runs as a coupled magnetosphere-ring current system. Options are available in Voltron to not enable RCM coupling, i.e. pure MHD mode, while only keep the field line tracing capacity in RCM. 

Checklist
---------

Here is a checklist of SIX necessary ingredients you should go over before launching a Voltron run:


#. Executable: e.g., voltron.x (serial run) or voltron_mpi.x (parallel run). See compilation instructions.
#. Grid file: e.g., lfmQ.h5. See script instructions for genLFM.py.
#. Solar wind file: e.g., bcwind.h5. See script instructions for omni2wind.py or gen_SW_kaiju.py.
#. RCM configuration file: e.g., rcmconfig.h5. See script instructions for genRCM.py.
#. Configuration file: e.g., cmriQ.xml. See `XML <./voltronXML>`_ instructions and pay attention to the differences between serial run and MPI run.
#. Job submission file: e.g., RunVOLTRON.pbs. See pbs instructions and pay attention to the differences between serial run and MPI run.

Compilation
-----------

Assume Kaiju repository has been installed successfully at $KAIJUDIR, and $KAIJUDIR/scripts has been added to $PATH and $KAIJUDIR added to $PYTHONPATH. (Instructions for installation can be found at https://bitbucket.org/aplkaiju/kaiju/wiki/Quick_Start.) The commands to compile for MPI parallelized Voltron, which is the mostly used mode, include:

.. code-block:: shell

   cd $KAIJUDIR
   module purge
   module restore kaiju
   rm -r build
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -DENABLE_MPI=ON -DENABLE_MKL=OFF ..
   make voltron_mpi.x

Here are more explanations and exceptions for the operations above.


#. "module restore kaiju" assumes that you have saved the eight necessary modules under your home directory. The eight necessary modules are listed below. If you haven't saved them, do "module purge", then "module load git/2.9.5" and one by one for each of the seven rest modules, then "module save kaiju".
   .. code-block::

      1) git/2.9.5
      2) intel/18.0.5
      3) hdf5/1.10.5
      4) impi/2018.4.274
      5) ncarenv/1.3
      6) ncarcompilers/0.5.0
      7) python/2.7.16
      8) cmake/3.14.4

#. 
   "rm -r build" is to clean up existing build directory to avoid any residual settings from previous compilations. Skip this if there is no build directory under $KAIJUDIR.

#. 
   "cmake -DENABLE_MPI=ON -DENABLE_MKL=OFF .." is for MPI parallelized run. The flag "-DENABLE_MPI" is by default off to compile serial run. The flag "-DENABLE_MKL" is also by default off and the gmres solver is used for the Posisson's equation. When "-DENABLE_MKL=ON", the threaded Intel pardiso solver is used. Recent tests show that Voltron results are not reproducible with MKL on. Pardiso only brings a few percent improvement of running speed. It is suggested to keep the default setting of MKL off. 

#. 
   "make voltron_mpi.x" is for MPI parallelized run. If compiling serial Voltron, simply use "make voltron.x" after "cmake ..".

#. 
   Additional notes from history page: The build system uses cmake which will attempt to auto-detect HDF5/OMP/MPI settings, however optionally you can provide a file "cmake/user.cmake" to set various variables if the auto-detect doesn't work.

#. 
   To check if your operations are in the right place, refer to the typical screen outputs when compiling:
   ```shell
   [(NPL) ] kaiju/build> cmake ..

   When cmake is ready, you can start compiling the executable with a simple make command:
   ```shell
   make voltron

Normal outputs look like this, showing the percentage of completeness:

Check the status of submitted job with 

.. code-block:: shell

   qstat -u username

Or real time output with 

.. code-block:: shell

   tail -f *.out

Quick lookup of run outcomes
----------------------------

A few python tools for diagnostics are available under $KAIJUDIR/scripts. The msphpic.py can be used to make some combined RCM/remix/Gamera figures like below:

.. image:: https://bitbucket.org/repo/kMoBzBp/images/1000851377-qkpic.png
   :target: https://bitbucket.org/repo/kMoBzBp/images/1000851377-qkpic.png
   :alt: qkpic.png


The gamsphVid.py can be used to generate multiple plots for making animations. Use "gamsphVid.py -h" for instructions on usage.

Some python libraries may need to be installed by Cheyenne users. Refer to https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/computational-systems/cheyenne/software/python for instructions on how to install.

MPI Differences
---------------

Running a coupled Gamera-RCM case with MPI support requires three things:


#. Building the MPI version of the coupled executable - see the `build instructions <../quickStart/install>`_.
#. Modifying case XML to supply additional MPI decomposition information
#. Modifying the submission script to request multiple nodes and use mpirun

Modifying Case XML
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Modifying a case XML for a coupled case is very similar to modifying one for an MHD-only case. The same modifications are required to **only the Gamera** section of the XML to define what the MPI decomposition is. Only Gamera currently supports decomposition, so no other sections of the XML require modification.

**Note that currently coupled Gamera-RCM only supports MPI decomposition in the I and J dimensions. Decomposition along the K dimension will result in errors or bad results.**

Three additional lines are required in the case XML file when running with MPI decomposition. And these lines are ignored by the non-MPI version of coupled Gamera, so you can safely leave them in the XML (if you want to) when not using MPI.

In the "\ :raw-html-m2r:`<Gamera>`\ " section of the XML, one line is required for each dimension that tells how many regions that dimension is decomposed into, and whether that dimension is periodic. Here is an example where the case is decomposed into 4 regions along the I and J axes, and not decomposed along the K axis. The I and J axes are not periodic, but the K axis is.

.. code-block:: shell

   <Gamera>
   ...
      <iPdir N="4" bcPeriodic="F"/>
      <jPdir N="4" bcPeriodic="F"/>
      <kPdir N="1" bcPeriodic="T"/>
   ...
   </Gamera>

Modifying Job Submission Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For information about creating job submission scripts, check the [[Gamerasphere]] article. Assuming that you have a job submission script suitable for running serial jobs, here is how to modify it to run coupled MPI gamera. These examples will be designed to work with Cheyenne, but can be adapted to most clusters.

First, you need to request an appropriate number of nodes and tell the job submission system how many MPI ranks should be created per node. Continuing the example above, this case is decomposed 4 times along the I dimension, and not at all along the J or K dimensions. So this case will need a total of 4\ *1*\ 1=4 MPI ranks **for Gamera**\ , and one additional MPI rank for coupled RCM.

For this example we will assign one MPI rank to each physical processor/socket for Gamera, which provides a reasonable balance between performance and cost. Each of Cheyenne's compute nodes has two processors/sockets, so this means that each compute node will receive two MPI Gamera ranks. The coupled RCM MPI rank is more resource intensive, and so will get an entire compute node to itself. The original, serial, resource request line from the job submission script looked like this:

.. code-block:: shell

   #PBS -l select=1:ncpus=72:ompthreads=72

That line requests all 72 cpus on a single compute node, which is perfect for a single process. We want to create a total of 5 processes spread across three compute nodes. We want 2 compute nodes with 2 MPI ranks each which will give us 4 ranks for Gamera, and then 1 compute node with 1 MPI rank by itself for coupled RCM. That looks like this:

.. code-block:: shell

   #PBS -l select=2:ncpus=36:mpiprocs=2:ompthreads=36+1:ncpus=36:mpiprocs=1:ompthreads=72

** Note that in larger cases you will want to add helper ranks that share some of the workload assigned here to the coupled RCM rank. Those helper ranks will also require entire nodes, and should be added to the latter portion of the PBS select command. A command that adds 2 more nodes for helpers compared to the one above (5 nodes total) would look like this:

.. code-block:: shell

   #PBS -l select=2:ncpus=36:mpiprocs=2:ompthreads=36+3:ncpus=36:mpiprocs=1:ompthreads=72

The line that controls the number of OMP threads should also be cut in half since we now have 2 Gamera processes per node:

.. code-block:: shell

   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=36

The only other line we need to change is the one that calls the executable and starts the simulation. In the serial case that looked like this:

.. code-block:: shell

   ${EXE} ${RUNID}.xml ${JNUM} > ${RUNID}.${JNUM}.out

That command literally calls the executable and passes it the input XML file. Instead, we now need to use a helper application called mpirun, which will call our executable for us:

.. code-block:: shell

   mpirun ${EXE} ${RUNID}.xml ${JNUM} > ${RUNID}.${JNUM}.out

Using MPT
^^^^^^^^^

If you are running with the MPT mpi library, the submission script will require some additional modifications, described in a dedicated wiki page [[Running with MPT]].
