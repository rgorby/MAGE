These are instructions to run the RCM stand-alone driver.

Follow the instructions in the quick start section, once the standard drivers can be compiled you can use the same build system to run "make rcm.x" which will create the driver.

In addition to the binary "rcm.x" there are two additional files that are needed. The first is the RCM config which can be generated using the "genRCM.py" script under "kaiju/scripts", this will create a file "rcmconfig.h5". The second is an input deck XML, an example of which is below

.. code-block:: shell

   <RCM>
     <output debug="F" toRCM="F" toMHD="F"/>
   </RCM>

Assuming the XML deck is called "rcmtest.xml" then the executable can be run simply with "rcm.x rcmtest.xml". The experimental new clawpack version can be enabled by editing "kaiju/src/rcm/rcm_include.h" and changing "doClaw95" to true.

.. code-block:: shell
