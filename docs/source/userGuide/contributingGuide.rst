General Info
============

----

This guide assumes that you have already checked out a local copy of our
git repository using the other pages in our wiki. If not, please check
other pages first such as `System Setup <SysSetup>`_.

This guide will talk about concepts such as pull requests and branching.
Details about them are beyond the scope of this guide, so for additional
information about them please refer to resources such as these:

Branch Setup
============

----

In our repository we have designated the branch named "master" as both
the "Main" branch, and as the "Production" branch.

Because it is the "Main" branch, whenever anyone downloads our
repository, this is the default branch that they will see and use.

Because it is the "Production" branch, we only merge new changes and
features into it periodically once we are confident that these new
features are stable and correct.

We have also designated the branch named "development" as the
"Development" branch. This branch is where new and experimental features
should be added so that they can be tested thoroughly.

Periodically, the "development" branch gets pulled into the "master"
branch and marks a new release of the code. This way anyone using the
code does not accidentally check out an unstable or untested feature
(but if they want to, they can use the "development" branch and all of
its latest features).

Branch Access
=============

----

The "development" and "master" branches are locked from direct access,
so noone is allowed to push any changes directly to either branch. All
changes are required to be done by pull requests (explained below). This
ensures that all code added to the "development" branch has some level
of review, and prevents anyone from accidentally pushing changes
directly to the production "master" branch.

Contributing Code
=================

----

Whenever someone has a new feature, bugfix, or anything that they want
to add to the repository, they begin by making a new branch off of the
"development" branch. We recommend naming the new branch something
descriptive about the work being added, but it can be named whatever you
like. This new branch **must** come off of the "development" branch,
because that is where new work gets merged into the code base.

Once the new feature has been completed (and **tested**\ ), you can submit
a pull request through the bitbucket website so that this feature branch
can be merged into the "development" branch. One or more developers or
other appropriate experts will review the changes in the branch, and
then either approve the pull request (at which point the branch is
merged into "development" and the code is now part of the repository),
or reject the pull request with an explanation as to what additional
changes may be needed to the code in the feature branch.

A list of recommended reviewers is available `here <recommendedReviewers>`_.
