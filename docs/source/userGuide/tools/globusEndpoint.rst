Setting up and sharing NCAR GLADE data via a Globus Collections
===============================================================

.. Users with accounts on NCAR's HPC systems can now share data with other users via Globus.  The other users will not need an NCAR account, but depending on the permissions you select for sharing they may need to setup a free Globus account to access the data.  

.. First a bit of terminology.  Users interact with collections and a *mapped collection* is a set of files hosted at an endpoint.  The NCAR GLADE filesystem is a mapped collection.  Users can create a guest collection from a mapped collection with distinct sharing permissions.

.. You will need to authenticate to the *NCAR mapped collections* via `Globus.org <https://app.globus.org/>`_ with your Globus Id.  Using the File manager option you will need search for NCAR GLADE collection.  Choose the one with the description for GridFTP access to GLADE filesystem using UCAS token authentication.  You will need to login with your NCAR id and duo token.  If you want to share data from the NCAR campaign storage system you need to use the file manager to search for NCAR Campaign Storage.  Remember that the campaign storage system is not accessible from cheyenne and data must be transfer to it via casper.

.. It is highly recommended to create bookmarks of the NCAR Glade and NCAR Campaign collections as they will be the starting point for creating any guest collection to share data with other users.

.. To share a directory with other Globus users first create the directory on the NCAR filesystem you wish to share with other users.  Via the Globus website use your bookmarks to navigate to the file system you just created and then select the share option to create a new guest collection.  The image below show how to share the directory /glade/campaign/hao/msphere/wiltbemj/ExampleShare as a guest collection.

.. Once you click share you will need to choose the option for creating a new guest collection and then you'll need to provide the required display name and meta data.  If the data is related to a publication you can provide the DOI in the information link available in *view more fields* option on the web page.

.. Once you create the collection you will have option to add permissions for sharing the data with other users.    There are currently for levels of sharing, specific users, groups, all global users, and public.  The web site will then provide a `link  <https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=92ac5357-f5e6-4b01-bbf4-b1bb8c06af1f&origin_path=%2F>`_ that you can use for sharing with other users.
